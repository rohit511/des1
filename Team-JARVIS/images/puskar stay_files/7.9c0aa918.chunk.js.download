As Kunal Nayyar said in his autobiography, Holi is India on steroids and places like Pushkar and Mathura live by it. On the other hand, if you\'re not a fan of the rowdiness and mess, there are more serene ways to celebrate Holi in India too. For example, the Kullu valley of Himachal celebrates Holi with folk music, dance, and community merriment amidst the gorgeous Himalayas.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Conveniently, 2020 is generous enough to make Holi fall on Monday &amp; Tuesday (9 &amp; 10 March), so that makes for a great opportunity to explore a new place and make good use of the long weekend from 7 to 10th March! So, go through our top 9 recommendations to find out which Holi celebration suits you the best and get headed!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>\\r\\n    Pushkar\\r\\n</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Talking about Holi and not mentioning Pushkar is unfair. Be it the procession at the Pushkar Chowk or the non-stop EDMs played by DJs to groove to, the international crowd to sheer desi happenstance of events around you- the dry Holi in Pushkar is far from just a celebration. Watchout for highlights such as these:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Everyone dresses flamboyantly and joins the procession on the main day from 10 AM to 5 PM. From feather dresses to glitter and ball masks, the Pushkar square turns into a party place with EDM, non-stop colours and dance, and bhang!\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Performances and activities take place at a stage set up in the middle of the procession; you can either perform or enjoy other people\u2019s talents. :)\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        A Holi mandate popularly rooted in the Indian state is Bhang- an edible preparation of cannabis, which is legally available in Government-authorized shops and is sure to \u2018high\u2019ten your festivities.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Another significant practice is the Kapda Phaad Holi. Thankfully, it is only limited to the men. You\u2019ll initially enter the grounds fully clothed only to get your t-shirts ripped and hanged on a giant rope for display.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Pushkar is known to celebrate Holi in a dynamic way.\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1804\\" data-id=\\"1437\\" height=\\"2406\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/pushkar.jpg\\" width=\\"1804\\">\\r\\n<pre>The procession in Pushkar is packed with travellers and residents alike.</pre>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Both&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.zostel.com/zostel/pushkar/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Zostel</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.zostel.com/homes/zostelx/pushkar-rajasthan/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Zostelx Pushkar</a> contribute to the madness that the city witnesses. Check them out here!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>\\r\\n    Rishikesh\\r\\n</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    This town does not lag behind when it comes to celebrating with a bang. The hippie capital of Uttarakhand makes its mark on the festival of Holi by organising a collective gathering at the Lakshman Jhula parking. With the rest of the city being closed for that afternoon, everyone heads to the celebration.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Go out only after a heavy breakfast as the town is most likely to be closed till early evening.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Keep all your gadgets in a plastic bag/wrap since it is likely to get messy. Better would be if you leave your electronics behind and go free handed.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        I know it is too obvious to state but please ask for consent before applying gulaal on anybody at the festival grounds. It is important that the person feels comfortable and the phrase \u2018Bura na maano, Holi hai.\u2019 can find its importance elsewhere.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Oil yourself before heading out. This is a little trick to easily get rid of all the solid colours from your skin after the celebration.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"The celebrations in Rishikesh kick in for the festival of colours.\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"4000\\" data-id=\\"1438\\" height=\\"3000\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/rishikesh.jpg\\" width=\\"4000\\">\\r\\n<pre>The parking area near Lakshman Jhula- where all the fun begins in Rishikesh for Holi.</pre>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Looking for budget-friendly stays as you experience the city on Holi?

Away from the noise and the traditional version of Holi that we are used to, Sangla Valley hosts a 2-day affair mostly with the involvement of local communities and traditions. The festivities kick in with the Holika Dahan where locals usually sing and play instruments around the pyre in infectious merriment.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The next day arrives with all the more excitement. Colours splash around covering every old mountain and new blades of grass like a sketchbook. The local wine (Phasur) flows freely, lightening up the surroundings even more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"The lively Holi procession in Sangla Valley.\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1080\\" data-id=\\"1439\\" height=\\"720\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/sangla_valley.jpg\\" width=\\"1080\\">\\r\\n<pre>Celebration right under the mountains in Sangla Valley.

The banks of the Tungabhadra River shine with residents gathered around to playfully enjoy the festival from early morning to evening. The sight of brown grainy mountains scattered around the ancient ruins of the Vijayanagara Kingdom are worth all your time. And of course Bhaang and booze intensify everything.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Hampi celebrates Holi with a lot of enthusiasm down South.\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1080\\" data-id=\\"1440\\" height=\\"1080\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/hampi.jpg\\" width=\\"1080\\">\\r\\n<pre>Hampi witnesses the festivities amidst ruins of ancient temples.

The birthplace of Lord Krishna, who invented the festival, Mathura hosts a week-long soiree of joyous events.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        The Lath Maar Holi celebrated in Nandgaon and Barsana mark the beginning of the week of Holi in Uttar Pradesh. The male residents of the respective towns gleefully dress up as Krishna and head to the streets where the women beat them (playfully, of course) with sticks.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Phoolon ki Holi is another such spectacle that occurs in Gulaal Kund. The enactment of Raas-Leela where the locals double up as performers is the highlight of the day.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        Celebrations continue at the Banke Bihari Temple in Vrindavan where clouds of colours burst in thin air making everything in their way vivid.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n        The Holi procession in Mathura is the epitome of cultural diversification. Plays, skits, tableaux, and floral decorations are some of the ingredients of the crazy cocktail this city makes for the spectators.\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Mathura comes to life during Holi.\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1080\\" data-id=\\"1441\\" height=\\"1350\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/mathura.jpg\\" width=\\"1080\\">\\r\\n<pre>The barely recognizable faces during the Mathura celebrations on Holi.

The jolliness starts at nine early in the morning with the locals smearing each other\u2019s faces with gulaal and goes on till about five.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h2>\\r\\n    Udaipur\\r\\n</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Holi in Udaipur is a refreshing change from the other cities, considering its celebrations are royal. The 2-day celebration comprises the Mewar Holika Dahan, which takes place in the City Palace. The royal family takes the lead by lighting the pyre, followed by the locals performing Gair (a traditional folk dance). A procession then commences, oozing with music played by a live band. Starting from Shambhu Niwas Palace, it goes up to Manek Chowk aka the Royal Residence. The final punctuation is a royal feast for all the attendees and a firework show.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"City-wide celebrations in Udaipur.\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1080\\" data-id=\\"1442\\" height=\\"1350\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/udaipur.jpg\\" width=\\"1080\\">\\r\\n<pre>Gulaal takes over the city streets in Udaipur.

Elaborate by design, the stepwells served as basins during the rainy season, so that water could be stored for dryer periods. The sacred element of water awarded the stepwells a semi-deific quality. Places of both prayer and physical replenishment, they became important centers of the community for local residents, still commanding a powerful spiritual presence through their natural serenity and spacious designs to any who visit today. Here are five of the most beautiful and rewarding of India\u2019s water temples and information on how to find them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h1>\\r\\n    Rani Ki Vav\\r\\n</h1>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Often touted as the grandest of all stepwells in India in terms of both scale and intricacy of design, the Rani is an excellent starting point for those considering a tour of the idyllic stepwells of India. Panel carvings, figurines and galleries depicting Vishnu\u2019s 10 faces, mean this destination is steeped in history and culture.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Rani ki Vav, a stepwell in Patan, Gujarat\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"2359\\" data-id=\\"1408\\" height=\\"1783\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/Rani_Ki_Vav_Patan_1.jpg\\" width=\\"2359\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The Rani Ki Vav is located in Gujarat in the Patan district. It costs approximately 200 rupees to enter as a foreigner, and it may be best to hire a taxi from Ahmedabad as the Rani lies roughly 130 kilometers outside the city.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h1>\\r\\n    Chand Baori\\r\\n</h1>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Chand Baori, situated in Abhaneri, Rajasthan is a unique geometrical 20-meter-deep (or 64&nbsp;feet) well with four sides. The steps and water surround three, but you meet a beautiful,&nbsp;carved three-storied pavilion on the fourth side, with two balconies and many fascinating&nbsp;carvings and sculptures from the Pratihara dynasty. It is also the deepest stepwell in India\u2013&nbsp;13 floors deep!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Chand Baori stepwell in Abhaneri near Jaipur, Rajasthan\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"2453\\" data-id=\\"1409\\" height=\\"1635\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/Chand_Baori_Step-well_at_Abhaneri.jfif.jpg\\" width=\\"2453\\">\\r\\n<pre>Chand Baori, one of the most beautiful stepwells of Rajasthan</pre>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Built by King Chanda in the 9th century, if you want to visit this breathtaking landmark, you\u2019ll&nbsp;have to go looking for it. The Chand Baori is around 95km from Jaipur but has no direct&nbsp;buses. The town of Abhaneri can be reached easily enough from Jaipur&nbsp;though. One option is to take a taxi from Sikandra. But you could also take a bus to Gular&nbsp;and then walk for an hour to Abhaneri.&nbsp;Abhaneri is still relatively tourist-free, for a town housing India\u2019s largest stepwell. So, entry is&nbsp;free and exploration is unhindered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h1>\\r\\n    Agrasen Ki Baoli\\r\\n</h1>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Situated in the center of Dehli, the Agrasen Ki Baoli is well kept and easily accessible, making it one of the top places to visit in Delhi. Long and narrow, with distinctive cobbled coves, the structure plummets down expansively, giving the illusion of a stairwell of infinite descent. During the day, the surrounding trees filter dappled light over its archways and walls, giving the spot a sense of peaceful relief from the claustrophobic chaos of India\u2019s capital city.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Agrasen Ki Baoli, top things to do in Delhi\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1024\\" data-id=\\"1407\\" height=\\"506\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/31216628313_fb374e3cd7_b.jpg\\" width=\\"1024\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Being one of the most accessible stepwells in India, many may wish to stop here as they experience the busy streets of India\u2019s major urban center. Travel on the Dehli metro to Barakhamba road to visit the Agrasen. It\u2019s free to enter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Did you know, we have two hostels in Delhi! One is in Paharganj, the jumbled &amp; euphoric part of the city, whereas the other one is in South Delhi, which is more of an upmarket, peace-loving area. Check out both <a href=\\"https://www.zostel.com/zostel/delhi/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Zostel Delhi</a> &amp; <a href=\\"https://www.zostel.com/zostel/south-delhi/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Zostel South Delhi</a> before you make your choice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h1>\\r\\n    Rajon Ki Baoli\\r\\n</h1>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The Rajon is also in Dehli but is situated in the quiet forests of the Mehrauli Archaeological Park. One of the most peaceful and quiet of India\u2019s stepwells, the Rajon is wider and feels more open in design, mirroring the sprawling natural grove it nestles within. It evokes a similarly Islamic style but features more ornate, detailed archways and fine patterns. At the same time, the Rajon is distinctively unkempt, with some damaged structures, showcasing the beauty of extraordinary craftsmanship reclaimed by nature.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Rajon Ki Baoli in Delhi, places to visit in Delhi\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"1024\\" data-id=\\"1406\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/rajon_ki_baoli.jpg\\" width=\\"1024\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The Rajon is easily accessible, lying just off the Qutab Minar Station on the Dehli Metro. Like many of the beautiful stepwells in India, the Rajon is also free to visit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Looking for more places to explore in Delhi? Check out our Delhi Travel Guide here.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h1>\\r\\n    Adalaj Vav\\r\\n</h1>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The Adalaj Vav, situated in Gujarat, is unique. Featuring a rising octagonal central space with box-like archways that almost give the illusion of infinity mirrors, the Adalaj is an incredible geometric undertaking. As a visitor, you can appreciate that the architects knew how to maximize the projection of space in this stepwell. Its expansiveness is otherworldly and bizarre. As stepwells were designed to function as receptacles for water during the monsoon, the maximization of space serves an equally impressive functional purpose.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    There\u2019s no fee to enter the Adalaj and it\u2019s much closer to Ahmedabad than the Rani, only 18 kilometers outside the city.

As a result of its location, it is often obscured and overshadowed by this major attraction but is well worth exploring. Its characteristic pyramidal steps are scorched in brazen yellow paint, which dances in contrast with the drowning black opal pool at its heart.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt=\\"Panna Meena Ka Kund in Jaipur Rajasthan\\" data-ce-max-width=\\"4608\\" data-id=\\"1405\\" height=\\"2112\\" src=\\"https://img.cdn.zostel.com/blog_photo/IMG_20181229_145159.jpg\\" width=\\"4608\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    This is a great place to visit along with the Amber Fort, ensuring you get to see both attractions when you choose to stay in Jaipur.

However, as luck would have it, our tatkal booking wasn\u2019t confirmed and we only had a couple of hours before we were supposed to leave for Udaipur from Surat. So, we made a booking on Redbus and left for Zostel Udaipur the same day, feeling as carefree and crazy as ever (we didn\u2019t plan or book the trip at all)!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<img alt data-id=\\"560\\" height=\\"1215\\" src=\\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/zo-media/blog_photo/old/Udaipur.Badshah_the_pug_kzyxXly.jpg\\" width=\\"2176\\">\\r\\n<p class=\\"caption\\">\\r\\n    <b>Zostel Udaipur- The place where it all began</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The only plan we had in mind was to cover as many Zostels as we can.

First of all, all the walls are painted beautifully enough to emanate a \u2018happening\u2019 vibe.

The Golden City shimmers in lights of earthen lamps, artificial lights, bonfires, flowers, and sweets.

The illuminated markets such as Bapu Bazar and Johri bazaar are filled with fine looking handicrafts and jewellery, and the streets filled with happy customers eager to shop as much as they can for the festival.

It prides itself in being a relaxed and slow-paced town and doesn\u2019t change much in its demeanor during Diwali. The streets and homes are decorated but the highlight is the Pushkar lake which is lit up with diyas (earthen lamps) on the periphery. While the town is lit up for Diwali, it is gearing up for the biggest, centuries old festival it is famous for- the Pushkar camel fair. The fair sees more than 50,000 visitors during the 5-day festivities. The most important part of the fair, the cattle trading, takes place in the first three days and the common shows, folk dances, and the camel race take centre stage in the later days.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Leave it to the citizens of Udaipur to celebrate Diwali in a royal way; they will never disappoint.

Affluent families prepare the signature dish of Rajasthan- Dal, Baati, Choorma. The farmers in the villages make plain rice which is eaten with Boora, which is powdered sugar. The people dress up in new clothes on this day- the men in Kurtas and Dhotis and the women in Lehngas. The highlight of the day is when everyone gathers in the evening, light up their home with a few earthen lamps; say their customary prayers and sits together for the family dinner.
